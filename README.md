# Description

## Functional objectives

The many features of the projects will be added in multiple parts

  - ### Part 1 : User management and simple Task management

    - User management with register, login, profile, edit and delete pages.

    - Tasks management with a list by author which will be the homepage and pages for the creation, profile, update and deletion of tasks.

- ## Technical Objectives


I wanted to use gedmo/doctrine-extensions and create an abstract class containing the Timestampaable fields createdAt & updatedAt that could have been inherited by Post and Commentaire Entities
